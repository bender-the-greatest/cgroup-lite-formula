cgroup-lite-formula
===================
Salt formula for cgroup-lite and configuration via the pillar. Currently designed for use on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

Note
~~~~
This formula is limited and does not support every feature of cgroups (e.g. it does not support cgroup permissions or nested groups at this time)
